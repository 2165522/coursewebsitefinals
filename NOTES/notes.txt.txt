Server-Side Web Scripting 


Java Servlets 
	- Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications..
	- handles client request by generating responses to such requests..

	- part of the Java EE specification (see Java Servlet API for more details)..

	- hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'..
	
	* servlet lifecycle;
	- instantiation => constructor call..
				- creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests..
				- invoked implicity by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client request and no instance currently exists..

	- initialization => init() method.. 
				- invoked only once and is intended for any startup initialization code for the servlet..
	
	- request handling => service() method..
				- invoked for each client request..
				- servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a responce..
				- multiple client requests are typically handled by a single, multi threaded servlet instance; thus, care must be exercised to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is 'thread-safe'..

	- destruction => destroy() method..
				- invoked before the servlet instance is 'unloaded', and is intended for any 'housekeeping' code that the servlet may need to run..

HTTPServlet
	- Java servlet used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses..
	- hosted in a 'Web container', which is a component in a Java 'application server' (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Red Har JBoss/WildFly, Oracle GlassFish, IBM WebSphere, etc.)..
	
	- the service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g., doGet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc..
	
	-the doXXX() methods are passed two arguments:
		-HTTPServletRequest
			-object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client and received by the servlet..

		- HttpServletResponse
			- object representation of the HTTP reponse generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client..
			- used to set information in the response message (e.g., HTTP response status code, message headers, message payload, etc.)..

* the web container facilitates the conversion to and from the HTTP request/response message to HTTPServletRequest/HTTPServletResponse..
