    <h1>Java Servlets</h1>
     <span class="anchor" id="css2"></span>
    <div class="cont" id="css">
        <ul>
            <li>Java objects that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications.</li>
            <li>handles client request by generating responses to such requests.</li>
            <li>part of the Java EE specification (see Java Servlet API for more details).</li>
            <li>hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Servlet Lifecycle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>instantiation => constructor call</li>
            <ul>
                <li>creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests.</li>
                <li>invoked implicity by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client request and no instance currently exists.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>initialization => init() method</li>
            <ul>
                <li>invoked only once and is intended for any startup initialization code for the servlet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>request handling => service() method</li>
            <ul>
                <li>invoked for each client request.</li>
                <li>servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a response.</li>
                <li>multiple client requests are typically handled by a single, multi threaded servlet instance; thus, care must be exercised to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is 'thread-safe'.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>destruction => destroy() method</li>
            <ul>
                <li>invoked before the servlet instance is 'unloaded', and is intended for any 'housekeeping' code that the servlet may need to run.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTTPServlet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Java servlet used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses.</li>
            <li>hosted in a 'Web container', which is a component in a Java 'application server' (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Red Har JBoss/WildFly, Oracle GlassFish, IBM WebSphere, etc.).</li>
            <li>the service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g., doGet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc.</li>
            <li>the doXXX() methods are passed two arguments:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTPServletRequest</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client and received by the servlet.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>HttpServletResponse</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>object representation of the HTTP reponse generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client.</li>
                    <li>used to set information in the response message (e.g., HTTP response status code, message headers, message payload, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li type = "none">* the web container facilitates the conversion to and from the HTTP request/response message to HTTPServletRequest/HTTPServletResponse.</li>
        </ul>
